    "client": "I guess the most pressing issue for me is a family. I’m over 30, and if I’m ever going to have children, it’s time."
    "interviewer": "Your biological clock is ticking."
    "client": "Yes. I really have to decide about this."
    "interviewer": "And so you’re wondering now whether you want to have a family."
    "client": "I guess I always thought I’d have kids at some point. It’s just that both of us had to get school out of the way, and then we started working, and suddenly I’m 34."
    "interviewer": "So maybe it’s getting a bit late to begin a family."
    "client": "Oh, I don’t know. Lots of people are having babies now who are older than we are. It’s fairly common, really."
    "interviewer": "I’m not saying that it’s uncommon. I guess I was just hearing some reluctance in your voice."
    "client": "Well, of course I’m somewhat reluctant. It’s a major life change, but I’ve always felt like I would have children at some point, and now is the time."
    "interviewer": "Why? What appeals to you about having a family?"
    "client": "It’s hard to say, really—it’s mostly a feeling I have. I guess it’s good to have children when you get older—someone to look after you."
    "interviewer": "Of course, that doesn’t always happen."
    "client": "I know. It’s also an experience I don’t want to miss out on. There’s more to life than work. I just feel it would be nice to be a mother."
    "interviewer": "What other advantages do you see?"
    "client": "Not advantages, really."
    "interviewer": "It’s not like you have children for what you can get out of them."
    "client": "Right! There’s something about being part of a new life, a part of the future"
    "interviewer": "Sounds pretty romantic."
    "client": "Well, I think it is! I know that it’s not all roses, and it costs a fortune, and you open yourself up to pain. It takes a lot of time to raise children. You have to give a lot."
    "interviewer": "It costs you a lot—not only in money but in time, too."
    "client": "And yet I feel like it’s worth it..."

    {
        "client": "So are you implying that I’m an addict?"
        "interviewer": "No, I’m really not concerned that much about labels. But it sounds like you are, that it’s a worry for you."
        "client": "Well, I don’t like being called an addict."
        "interviewer": "When that happens, you want to explain that your situation really isn’t that bad."
        "client": "Right! I’m not saying that I don’t have any problems . . ."
        "interviewer": "But you don’t like being labeled as “having a problem.” It sounds too harsh to you."
        "client": "Yes, it does."
        "interviewer": "That’s pretty common, as you might imagine. Lots of people I talk to don’t like being labeled. There’s nothing strange about that. I don’t like people labeling me, either."
        "client": "I feel like I’m being put in a box."
        "interviewer": "Right. So let me tell you how I see this, and then we’ll move on. To me, it doesn’t matter what we call a problem. I don’t care if we call it 'addiction' or 'problems' or 'Rumpelstiltskin,' for that matter. We don’t have to call it anything. If a label is an important issue for you, we can discuss it, but it’s not particularly important to me. What really matters is to understand how your use of cocaine is harming you, and what, if anything, you want to do about it. That’s what I care about."

        "client": "One obvious place where this is a problem for me is money."
        "interviewer": "In what ways is that a concern for you?"
        "client": "Well, I just spend a lot of money on gambling, and I’m not always paying my bills."
        "interviewer": "Tell me about the last time that happened."
        "client": "Just last week I went through about $600. I start out setting a limit,but then I lose that amount and decide to try to win it back."
        "interviewer": "Over time it really adds up."
        "client": "I’ll say. I’ve lost about $30,000 over the last 6 months."
        "interviewer": "And that’s a lot for you."
        "client": "We don’t have that kind of money. At least we don’t now."
        "interviewer": "How much does this money issue concern you?"
        "client": "It’s getting to be a big problem, and I worry about it all the time. I’ve  got people coming to the door, calling on the telephone, sending nasty letters. I’ve got to do something."
        "interviewer": "And in what specific ways does it affect you, to lose so much?"
        "client": "Nobody will give me credit any more, except the casinos. My husband finally noticed all the cash withdrawals, and he’s hardly talking to me."
        "interviewer": "What else?"
        "client": "He’s worried about our retirement security, of course. And I can’t buy things I want."
        "interviewer": "Such as . . ."
        "client": "The other day I saw this nice dress in just my size, and I couldn’t afford it. My credit cards have all been canceled. Then I get mad and do stupid things."

    {
    "client": ". . . Maybe it’s easier just to stay together and work on our relationship, at least until my daughter starts school."
    "interviewer": "So one of the most important considerations for you is how staying together or separating would affect your daughter."
    "client": "Right. I don’t want to mess up her life, just because mine has been a mess. It might be better for her to have two parents around, I guess, but then in some other ways he’s not the best influence on her."
    "interviewer": "What are some of those ways?"
    "client": "Well, like I told you, he has a bad temper. He’s never hit her so far, but she’s seen him beat me up, and that really upsets her."
    "interviewer": "It’s not good, you think, for her to see him hurting you, and you also worry that eventually he might hurt her physically as well."
    "client": "That’s got to be bad. It was awful last time. She was screaming and crying, but it didn’t stop him."
    "interviewer": "She was really scared, but that didn’t seem to matter; it didn’t keep him from hurting you more."
    "client": "Once he gets going like that, he doesn’t care about anyone or any thing. It’s like he’s in a blind rage."
    "interviewer": "And that’s terrifying for a 4-year-old girl, and for you as well. So even if you didn’t mind particularly what happens to you, it’s important to you to protect that little girl of yours."
    "client": "She’s so sweet. I just love her so much."
    "interviewer": "Enough, perhaps, to make this really hard choice..."
},
    {
    "client": "My parents really are too strict, and I hate that, but I guess it’s because they worry about me."
    "interviewer": "They care enough about you to set limits."
    "client": "But their rules are just  unreasonable!"
    "interviewer": "You wish, sometimes, that  they didn’t care about you so much,  because they go way overboard in trying to protect you."
    "client": "Right! I mean, I know they care about me. I’d just like them to give me more freedom and to trust me more."
},
    {"
        "interviewer": "Let me suggest that we try something here. It’s easy to get stuck in a decision like this because as soon as you think of an advantage of one possibility, you then think of its down side or an advantage of the other possibility. Let’s take the possibilities one at a time: stay here, or move. Let’s begin with staying here. What are the advantages?"
        "client": "It’s familiar—the devil you know, as they say. I’m not that happy at work, but I get along OK, and I know how to do my job well."
        "interviewer": "So your job here is OK. What else?"
        "client": "I have plenty of friends here, including some really close friends. I’d miss them a lot. I say I’d write or telephone, but the truth is that I get busy and don’t do it, and those friendships would drift away. Of course, I’m sure I could make new friends if I moved."
        "interviewer": "But that’s about option number two. Let’s stick with option one for now: staying here. So far you’ve said that your work situation is satisfactory, not great but familiar, and that you have good close friends here who are important to you. What else?"
        "client": "It’s kind of related, but the synagogue I attend is one that I really like, and it might be hard to find a community like that in a new city. It means a lot to me to go every sabbath, and I’m close to the rabbi and the people there. It builds me up spiritually."
        "interviewer": "OK. You have a strong faith community here. What else?"
        "client": "It might be better for Alison to finish school here. She has three more years to go, and she doesn’t want to move to a new school. And I like the weather here."
        "interviewer": "Work, friends, synagogue, school, weather. What else would be good about staying here?"
        "client": "I guess that’s about it. It’s always uncomfortable to pick up roots and start over in a new place, but it’s kind of exciting, too."
        "interviewer": "All right, good. Now let’s take a look at the other option you’re considering, to move for this new job. What would be the advantages of that?"
        "client": "(Laughs.) The first thing that occurs to me is that I’d be far away from my ex. The divorce was pretty ugly, and in a way I’d like to leave all that behind and start over. It’s silly, I guess, but somehow I think that moving would give me more of a feeling of starting a new life, without all of the constant reminders."
        "interviewer": "Funny that that’s the first thing you think of."
        "client": "Well, it would be getting away from unpleasant memories here. They are offering me a much better salary, too. I haven’t even told my boss here that I’m thinking about moving. It might be a better work environment, but it’s hard to tell. The people I met seem to enjoy working there. I’d have a little more responsibility in my new position, as well."
        "interviewer": "The new job itself has some real attractions for you: better pay, better colleagues, a more responsible position . . ."
        "client": "Not better colleagues, really. I like the people I work with now, but it’s a more pleasant building. It has big windows and doesn’t feel so cramped. I guess they need big windows, though, because it rains there all the time."
        "interviewer": "Nice windows, not such nice weather."
        "client": "The cost of living is higher there, too, but it’s a bigger city and has a lot to offer."
        "interviewer": "For example . . ."
        "client": "They have more museums and concerts and things, and a really good zoo. I think the schools are better."
        "interviewer": "Which might be better for Alison, and there would be more for you to do in your free time."
        "client": "I guess so."
        "interviewer": "What else?"
        "client": "I don’t really know that much else about it. Mainly it’s a way to get away from here and start over."
        "interviewer": "OK, so here we go with the big picture. Let me know if I leave something out. The advantages of staying here are that you’re settled in and it’s familiar. Moving to a new place always involves a certain amount of disruption. You know your job here, and while it’s not perfect, you know what to expect and how to do it. You have good friends here, and particularly important is your synagogue and the community you have there. You like the weather here, and Alison would prefer to stay here and finish school. Perhaps the biggest factor in favor of moving is your feeling of having a fresh new start. It would get you away from your ex, and painful reminders, and would give you a new lease on life. The job is  more responsible and the pay is better, in the context of a somewhat higher cost of living. The building where you would work is nicer, and the weather isn’t. There is more to do there, and the schools might be better for Alison. How’s that?"
        "client": "Excellent—but it doesn’t help me much. I still feel confused."
        "interviewer": "Of course you do. There’s not one clear right answer here. Did anything else occur to you as I was talking?"
        "client": "I realize I can tell my boss about the possibility of moving and see what happens. If she gets angry, that might help me decide to go. Or she might offer me a raise if she wants to keep me."
        "interviewer": "You’re not really sure which way it would go."
        "client": "I think probably she’d try to keep me. She seems to like my work. So that wouldn’t make the decision for me, either."
        "interviewer": "It might only remove one of the differences, the pay difference, and it sounds like that’s not one of the most important for you."
        "client": "Well, it’s important. I’d like to have a better salary, but it’s not the whole picture by any means."
        "interviewer": "Then let me ask you this: What is most important to you?"
        "client": "In my job?"
        "interviewer": "No, in life. What do you care most about? What do you value? What do you want to do with your life?"
        "client": "Big question! I care about Alison. I’m not just saying that because I’m supposed to. I really want the very best for her."
        "interviewer": "Specifically . . ."
        "client": "I want her to be happy. I don’t particularly care what she decides she wants to do in life. If she decides she wants more education, she’ll get it."
        "interviewer": "You love her very much."
        "client": "I do. We’re very close."
        "interviewer": "What else is important to you in life?"
        "client": "I’m a very spiritual person. I know there is more to life than what we can see. I feel like a kindergartner when it comes to religion, but I want to keep growing spiritually."
        "interviewer": "In what ways?"
        "client": "I don’t know how to explain it exactly, but there is a path that I’m meant to walk, and I want to be sure I’m on it. I keep a Jewish home, and that’s important to me."
        "interviewer": "So that’s part of the question here, too. One of these two possibilities is on the right path for you, but which one?"
        "client": "Yes. It seems like it ought to be clear, but it’s not."
        "interviewer": "Alison, spiritual growth . . . What else is top priority for you?"
        "client": "I want to be with someone again, probably to be married again. I don’t want to live out my life alone. I have Alison, but she’ll need to have her own life."
        "interviewer": "What about the things you cherish most in life?"
        "client": "I love being outdoors, in nature. I love music; I’m not a musician, but I love listening to classical music. And my friends are important to me—  having at least a few good, close friends who share everyday life with me."
        "interviewer": "What about your work?"
        "client": "I don’t think I’m going to change the world. Work is a job. I enjoy doing it, but when I go home, then I’m home. I’m much more a people person."
        "interviewer": "What you’ve mentioned so far, as the things in life that really matter to you, are your daughter, your faith, being married again or at least having a life partner, nature, and music, and having close friends. How might these values fit in with staying here or moving?"
        "client": "It sounds like moving just for a new job doesn’t make much sense. That’s not really what this is about. I have friends, and synagogue, and a life here, and Alison wants to stay. There are some attractive things there, but really it’s this feeling of needing a new start, wanting to break free."
        "interviewer": "And a move would do that."
        "client": "You know, I’m not even sure about that. It’s more a feeling I have . . .
     },
    {"
     "client": "I just can’t do this work much longer. It’s too dangerous, and I’m going to end  up dead. I have my daughter to think of,  too. I don’t want her to have the same kind of life I’ve had. I’m a wreck as a  mother—shooting up in the bathroom so she doesn’t see me, out half the night. Now the social worker is threatening to take her away from me again, and I don’t blame him. I can’t go on like this."
     "interviewer": "It’s a desperate situation you’re in, and you really want out."
     "client": "I came close to getting out the other night, but not the way I want to—in a box."
     "interviewer": "You were nearly killed."
     "client": "I’ve come close before, but that one really scared me—the guy I told you about."
     "interviewer": "So what’s the next step? How do you get out?"
     "client": "That’s just it. What can I do? . . ."
     "interviewer": "You feel stuck, with no way out."
     "client": "No shit! I have no money. I’m on probation. CC watches me like a hawk, and beats me up and cuts off my drugs if he even thinks I’m holding out on him. We live in a cheap motel room. What am I supposed to do?"
     "interviewer": "That’s exactly the question you’re faced with. You want out, but how in the world can you overcome so many incredible obstacles?"
     "client": "I just don’t see a way. Otherwise I’d be out of here."
     "interviewer": "I certainly don’t have the answers for you, but I have a lot of confidence that you do, and that working together we can find a way out."
     "client": "What do you mean?"
     "interviewer": "Well, for one thing, you’re an amazing survivor. I can’t believe how strong you are, to have gone through all you’ve been through and even be alive, let alone sitting here and talking to me about what you want your life to be like in the future. I don’t think I could have survived what you’ve been through."
     "client": "You do what you have to."
     "interviewer": "How have you come this far and still have the amount of love and compassion that I see in you—not only for your daughter, but for the women you work with, and for other people as well? How do you do it?"
     "client": "Just one day at a time, like they say. I don’t know. I just go way inside, like when I’m doing some john. I don’t let myself get hurt. I take care of myself."
     "interviewer": "Like you take care of your daughter."
     "client": "I hope I take better care of her than I do of myself. But yeah, I take care of myself. Nobody else does."
     "interviewer": "So you have this amazing in ner strength, a solid core inside you where you can’t be hurt."
     "client": "Or don’t let myself be hurt."
     "interviewer": "Oh, right! It’s not that you can’t feel anything, because you do. You have a way of preserving that loving woman inside you, keeping her safe. So one thing you are is strong. How else might you describe yourself? What other qualities do you have that make you a survivor?"
     "client": "I think I’m pretty smart. I mean, you can see what’s going on around me, and I don’t miss much"
     "interviewer": "You’re a strong and loving woman, and pretty smart. What else?"
     "client": "I don’t know."
     "interviewer": "What might someone else say about you, someone who knows you well? What good qualities might they see in you, that could help you make the changes you want?"
     "client": "Persistent. I’m downright bullheaded when I want something."
     "interviewer": "Nothing stops you when you make up your mind, like a bull."
     "client": "I do keep going when I want something."
     "interviewer": "Strong and loving, smart, persistent. Sounds like you have a lot of what it takes to handle tough changes. How about this? Give me an example of a time when you really wanted something, and you went after it."
     "client": "You won’t like it."
     "interviewer": "Try me."
     "client": "I was out of shit last week, and I really wanted it something bad. CC thought I was cheating him, keeping money and not telling him, and so he cut me off. I asked around and nobody had any to give me. It was the afternoon and nothing was happening on the street. So I took my daughter and went over to the freeway entrance. I had to wait until CC went for dinner. I made up this sign that said, “Hungry. Will work for food.” In an hour I had enough to get what I needed, and some food for us, too. CC never found out about it."
     "interviewer": "It’s all the things you said. You had to time it all carefully, but you’re so aware of what’s happening around you that you could do it. You  think quickly, and came up with a solution. You stuck with it, and made it happen. How did you make the sign?"
     "client": "Cardboard I found in the motel dumpster, and I borrowed a marker at the desk."
     "interviewer": "They seem like little things, but I’m impressed at how quickly you solved this one. I’m sad, of course, that all this creativity was spent on getting drugs, but it’s just one example of how you can make things happen when you put your mind to it."
     "client": "Now that’s another thing. What do I do about being hooked? The withdrawals are bad."
     "interviewer": "You’ve been through them be fore, then."
     "client": "Sure. In jail, on the street, even in a detox once, but I don’t want to go through it again."
     "interviewer": "Tell me about the detox. When was that?"
     "client": "Last year. I got real sick and they took me to the emergency room, and from there they took me to detox. I stayed about five days, but I got high right afterward."
     "interviewer": "But what was the detox like for you?"
     "client": "It was OK. They were nice to me, and they gave me drugs so that I didn’t feel uncomfortable. As soon as I hit the street, though, I wanted a fix."
     "interviewer": "So it was possible, at least, for you to get through the withdrawal process comfortably. The problem came when you went back out. Now let me ask you this. Imagine that you’re off the street—like magic. You’re through withdrawals and away from the street, out of CC’s reach somewhere else completely. Don’t worry for the moment about how you got there— we’ll come back to that—but you’re free, just you and your daughter. What would you do? What kind of life would you choose?"
     "client": "I’d need to find a real job. Maybe I’d go back to school and then get a good job. I’d like to get out of the city—live in a little place out in the country somewhere."
     "interviewer": "A complete change of scenery."
     "client": "That’s what it would take."
     "interviewer": "And you can imagine it, a new life somewhere with your daughter."
     "client": "I can imagine it, yes. But how could I get there?"
     "interviewer": "It’s such a big change, with so many obstacles, that you don’t think you could do it."
     "client": "I don’t know. I might be able to. I just haven’t thought about it for a long time."
     "interviewer": "Maybe, just maybe, with all your strength and smarts and creativity and stubborn persistence, you could find a way to pull it off. It’s what you want, is it?"
     "client": "Yeah, it would be great, getting off the street."
     "interviewer": "Is this just a pipe dream here, or do you think you might actually be able to do it?"
     "client": "It seems kind of unrealistic, for me at least."
     "interviewer": "For you. But it might be possible for . . ."
     "client": "I guess I was thinking of my daughter. Or maybe some other women I know, but then I think I’d have as good a chance as they would."
     "interviewer": "Good! You can imagine you doing it, just like others might. Let me just ask you to do one more thing, then, before we get any more specific. Let’s think about what it would take for you to get from the street to that place you imagined. And let’s be creative. Let’s think of any way at all that it might happen, as many different ways as possible. They can be completely unrealistic or unlikely, no matter. What we want is a lot of ideas. OK?"
     "client": "Sure, why not."
     "interviewer": "So how might it happen?"
     "client": "I could meet a sugar daddy, like that girl in the Pretty Woman movie."
     "interviewer": "OK, good. That’s one. What else?"
     "client": "There could be a miracle. (Laughs.)"
     "interviewer": "Right. One miracle coming up. What else?"
     "client": "I could talk my mom into bailing me out again. If she thought I was really serious this time, she might do it."
     "interviewer": "So your mom could help get you out of here, with money."
     "client": "She’s worried about her granddaughter, I know. We might even be able to live with her for a while, but I don’t know if she’ll ever trust me again."
